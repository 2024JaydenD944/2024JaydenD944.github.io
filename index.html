<h4>Description</h4>
<div>
You and your 2 friends go to a carnival during the weekend, you see a corn maze and decide to enter. Surprisingly, when you went to the entrance, there was nobody there to let you in. The group thought about what to do, so you guys decided to go in. It was around 8:30 when you guys arrived at the corn maze, soon after, it was nightfall. It was a normal walk until you guys heard a strange sound coming from the bushes.
